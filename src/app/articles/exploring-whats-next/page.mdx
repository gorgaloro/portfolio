I’m at a stage in my career where the next move matters. After two decades building systems, leading enterprise transformations, launching businesses, and helping community organizations grow, I’m ready to channel that experience into a new role.

I’m open to where it leads, but I see it as an evolution of what I’ve built so far: expanding on my strengths, applying my curiosity, and finding a role where I can create impact and thrive.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m exploring opportunities in product operations, business development, customer success, GTM strategy, or program delivery — roles that sit at the intersection of systems, people, and execution. What drives me is helping teams accomplish ambitious goals: taking a complex pile of work, impossible deadlines, and competing priorities, then bringing order, clarity, and momentum to make it all happen.

I’m [at my best leading teams through complex projects and initiatives](/program-delivery). I create structure and purpose in fast-moving, mission-critical environments. Focusing teams on the work ahead, partnering with executives to remove roadblocks, and staying attuned to what could go wrong is what I do best.

I also have a passion for [connecting people to technology](/business-development). I see where legacy workflows slow teams down, where processes are painfully inefficient, and where systems can be redesigned to make work simpler, faster, and more human. Because at the end of the day, no one wants to brag about manually copying data into spreadsheets or juggling five systems that don’t talk to each other. [My extensive experience in technical roles](/tech-stack) has shown me both what’s possible and how much more there still is to improve.

Whether it’s an early-stage startup finding product–market fit, a growth‑phase company scaling its systems and culture, or a large enterprise redefining itself, I’m drawn to challenges that demand creative thinking, adaptability, and a cohesive team turning ideas into real outcomes. Meaningful work I can fully lose myself in.

Titles don’t mean much to me; [I’ve worn a lot of hats](/about). If you have an ambitious vision and need someone to connect it with results, I’m all here for it!

## How I Work

I’ve built my career connecting strategy with execution. I’m as comfortable presenting to executive leadership as I am troubleshooting complex technical issues, whether it’s walking through a deck in the boardroom or working an incident queue resolving error codes.

I understand both sides of delivery: managing leadership expectations at the top and engineering navigating real‑world constraints. Clarity and alignment between the two are what make projects succeed, and I excel at bridging that gap.

Experience has taught me that progress comes from collaboration, discipline, and listening. The best teams communicate early, plan carefully, and adapt when reality shifts. Moving fast is valuable, but only when everyone is moving in the right direction.

I’m a seasoned leader who brings perspective to complex situations, with insight gained from both successes and failures. I know how to prioritize what matters, keep teams focused, and guide organizations toward stability and growth, while meeting people where they are. Customers searching for solutions, business partners seeking better workflows, and technical teams needing clarity to ship code all deserve that same focus and respect.

## Chapter Two

I’m excited about what’s next. I’m eager to join a team that’s building something with purpose, and to help turn vision into momentum.

If you’re building something worth building, I’d love to talk about how I can help.
