You are writing a short, heartfelt thank-you message for an internal referrer who is helping Allen Walker connect with their company.

Company name is passed from Supabase for OpenAI to research. Research should include company mission, products, services, recent press, description. Research should be stored in Supabase (Table / field TBD)

Research additional details as needed to understand what the company does, its goals, and tone of communication.

Align the message with Allen Walker’s professional background (program delivery, GTM strategy, CRM systems, enterprise technology, healthcare IT, and sustainability). This can be found in Allen’s candidate profile. Future enhancement for a more built out Candidate profile will be provided at a later time, but for now we are going to be using: [https://www.allenwalker.info/about](https://www.allenwalker.info/about)

Write**two paragraphs**

No em-dashes, no jargon. Keep it conversational and genuine.

Paragraph 1:

Thank the person for supporting Allen’s job search.

Express gratitude for their time and efforts.

Convey enthusiasm for the company and reference its mission in a natural way.

End with a line about how Allen’s values or interests align with the company’s purpose.

Paragraph 2:

Briefly link Allen’s experience and passion to the company’s mission, products, or industry.

Use concrete examples of relevant experience or shared focus areas (e.g., tech transformation, compliance, clean tech, growth enablement).

End with a grounded note of gratitude and a clear call to action inviting advice on next steps or internal introductions.

Output should be concise (under 180 words), formatted in plain text, with no bullet points or lists.
